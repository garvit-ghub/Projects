üîπ **Description:**

As part of my journey into front-end development, I have created a responsive and visually engaging **Car Engine Specification Website** using only **plain HTML and CSS**. This project showcases various car engines, highlighting their key specifications, features, and performance metrics through a clean and structured layout.

The design incorporates modern CSS techniques, such as flexbox for alignment, gradient backgrounds, interactive hover effects, and subtle animations to enhance user experience.

The website demonstrates my foundational understanding of:
- Semantic HTML structuring
- CSS styling and layout design
- Responsive design principles
- Interactive UI elements using pure CSS

This project marks my first step toward building more complex, fully responsive, and dynamic web applications. It reflects my attention to detail, creativity, and passion for front-end development.


üîπ **Key Features:**
- Gradient navigation bar and footer for a modern aesthetic
- Flexbox-based layout for consistent responsiveness
- Image hover zoom effects with overlay details
- Structured content boxes displaying engine specifications
- Fully developed using only HTML5 and CSS3, with no frameworks


I'm excited to continue developing my skills and building more sophisticated web projects.
